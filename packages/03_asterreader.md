Package can be used to read Code Aster .med and .rmed file formats.

<!-- more -->

To read Code Aster `.med` file (exported using SALOME), one has to write
```julia
aster_read_mesh(fn)
```
where `fn` is the name of the mesh file. Result is a simple dictionary.

In case of several mesh exists in a single file, one must provide also mesh name, e.g.
```julia
aster_read_mesh(fn, mesh_name="my_mesh")
```

Package can also be used to read results from `.rmed` files. This is still highly experimental feature and can be used mainly to compare calculation results done using Code Aster to results produced by own FE code.
