PKgTestSuite is a standard test suite to test packages under JuliaFEM organization. By using centralized testing script we can control testing of all packages from single place. In practice, PkgTestSuite is taking care of whole CI process, starting from running doctests, tests, syntax check + other tests. After that automatically generated documentation is deployed to organisation web-page.
