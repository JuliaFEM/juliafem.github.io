The need for a standardized method to exchange scientific data between High Performance Computing codes and tools lead to the development of the eXtensible Data Model and Format (XDMF) . Uses for XDMF range from a standard format used by HPC codes to take advantage of widely used visualization programs like ParaView, to a mechanism for performing coupled calculations using multiple, previously stand alone codes. Xdmf.jl can be utilized to work with Xdmf files in Julia projects.
