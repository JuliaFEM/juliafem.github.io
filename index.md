The JuliaFEM project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable,
distributed Finite Element Method.

The JuliaFEM software library is a framework that allows for the distributed
processing of large Finite Element Models across clusters of computers using
simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to 
thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. The basic 
design principle is: everything is nonlinear. All physics models are nonlinear 
from which the linearization are made as a special cases.
