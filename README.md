# juliafem.github.io / www.juliafem.org

Web pages for organization. The actual page is juliafem.github.io and www.juliafem.org is pointing
to same site.

## Adding content

**for contributors**: If you have all Jekyll related stuff installed on local machine, you can do
`bundle exec jekyll serve` and check from `localhost:4000` that content is OK. If that is the case,
you can then push directly to the master. Otherwise, create branch, do changes, make pull request
and ask someone to review changes locally before merging.

**for others**: Fork, do local changes, do pull request. If you want to be extra helpful and have
installed Jekyll things on local machine, you can add screenshot of page to PR to make it easier
for reviewers.
