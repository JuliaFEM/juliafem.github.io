# juliafem.github.io / www.juliafem.org

Web pages for organization. The actual page is juliafem.github.io and www.juliafem.org is pointing
to same site.

## Adding content

**for contributors**: If you have all [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) related stuff installed on
local machine (computer you are using to develop), you can do `bundle exec jekyll serve` and check
using your web browser from url address `localhost:4000`, (i.e. write to address bar `http://localhost:4000`)
that content is OK. **If that is the case**, you can then push directly to the
master. Otherwise, create branch, do changes, make pull request and ask someone to review changes
locally before merging.

**for others**: Fork, do local changes, do pull request. If you want to be extra helpful and have
installed Jekyll things on local machine, you can add screenshot of page to PR to make it easier
for reviewers.

Examples can be written using Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown. See
